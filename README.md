# Alpha_Book_Store_Management_System
Alpha book store management system is a book store system that simplifies the process of finding a book in a store. The system enables a customer to search a
book using the book name. Furthermore, the system allows other employees like the cashier to view the price and create a receipt for a purchase, a bookmanager
to add and remove books and a manager to generate the sale done in a day. 

To start using the system, run the first page file in the GUI folder. You will then be guided by the GUI.

A message from the writer
Hi, all. This project is my first java project and first to my group members. Thus, it is with a lot of drawbacks which I plan to fix in the coming future.
Besides, I am sure to come with other bigger projects. 

Thank You.
